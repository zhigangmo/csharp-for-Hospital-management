Doctor: Can view personal details, list of registered patients, all appointments, and details of specific patients based on ID.
Administrator: Can view all doctors, all patients, add new doctors, and add new patients.
Menus:

Different roles should have different menus.
The application should start with a Login Menu.

Additional Details:

Ensure strong Object-Oriented Principles are applied.
IDs for each entity should be unique and generated by the system.
Appropriate error messages should be shown wherever necessary.
Submission should include C# code, solution file, data file, and any special instructions.
Students need to ensure that the submitted application can be compiled and run without issues. Not being able to do so would result in zero marks.
